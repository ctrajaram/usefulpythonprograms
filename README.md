Binary File Processing with Python

This project provides a Python script to read, interpret, and process binary files according to a specific file structure.
Project Description

The program reads a binary file with a predefined structure. It then calculates the total check amount, total cash amount, and balance (checks - cashs) for a specific user id. Additionally, it counts the occurrences of "pay started" and "pay ended" records.
File Structure

The binary file has the following structure:

    Header:
        4 byte string "ABCD"
        1 byte version
        4 byte (uint32) number of records

    Record:
        1 byte record type enum (0x03: cash, 0x04: check, 0x05: paystarted, 0x06: payended)
        4 byte (uint32) Unix timestamp
        8 byte (uint64) user ID
        If the record type is cash or check, there is an additional field: an 8 byte (float64) amount in dollars at the end of the record

Dependencies

This project uses Python's built-in struct module to handle the binary data.
Usage

python

# Call the function passing the file
read_process_binary_file('binaryfile.dat')

Output

The output of the script will be:

mathematica

total check amount: NNNN.NN
total cash amount: NNNN.NN
pay started N
pay ended N
balance for user 123456789=N.N
